​The snow like whisper from other side 

In the calm I hear a mystery so deep

it pierces the heart of the night

---
 

A silent ring that time will never fade

That marks the dawn of everything

December in   your breath   

feeling serenity

---
 

We spin within time

The present calls

‘Here is where to be’

---
 

what‘s life but light and shade

A passing shadow or a spark that stays in moodnight

Searching for the  whispers of time.

---
​

what‘s life but light and shade  

A passing shadow or a spark that stays in moodnight

The meaning rises  within the now

and you are in  the heart of it all

---

 

The wind like whispers from a distant place

In the still, I hear a memory so clear

it stirs the heart of the dawn

---

A silent chord that time will never break

That holds the thread of everything

December in your eyes

feeling infinity

---

We flow within time,

The present calls: 

Here is where to stay.

---
​

Under the fading sky, the path unfolds,

Even as time slips by silently

With every heartbeat, we leave a mark behind

---

What’s life but light and shade?

A fleeting shadow or a fire ablaze in mood-night

Chasing the whispers of time

---

What’s life but light and shade?

A fleeting shadow or a fire ablaze in mood-night

The meaning awakens within the now

And you remain the heart of it all
